## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v20.18.3)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold-ETH 2, follow the steps below:

1. Install dependencies if it was skipped in CLI:

```
cd my-dapp-example
yarn install
```

2. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Foundry. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `packages/foundry/foundry.toml`.

3. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/foundry/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/foundry/script` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

Run smart contract test with `yarn foundry:test`

- Edit your smart contracts in `packages/foundry/contracts`
- Edit your frontend homepage at `packages/nextjs/app/page.tsx`. For guidance on [routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) and configuring [pages/layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts) checkout the Next.js documentation.
- Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/foundry/script`

Trustless p2p platform

# First idea flow

Detailed User Flow: Bob Buying USDC from Alice
Let me walk you through the complete user journey for Bob, who has fiat currency and wants to purchase USDC from Alice's existing order.
üéØ Initial Setup
Alice (Seller):

Has 100 USDC in her smart wallet
Created an order: "Sell 100 USDC for 500 BOB (Boliviano)"
Already signed EIP-7702 authorization allowing the OrderBook contract to transfer her USDC only if payment is verified

Bob (Buyer):

Has 500 BOB in his bank account
Wants to buy 100 USDC
Has a Web3 wallet (MetaMask) connected to the dApp


üì± Step-by-Step User Flow
Step 1: Bob Discovers the Order
Bob opens the P2P Exchange dApp
‚Üì
Connects his MetaMask wallet
‚Üì
Views available orders on the marketplace
‚Üì
Sees Alice's order: "100 USDC for 500 BOB"
‚Üì
Clicks "View Details" to see:
- Exchange rate: 5 BOB per USDC
- Alice's reputation/history
- Order expiration time
- Payment instructions
Frontend Code Example:

```
javascript// Bob sees this order in the UI
const order = {
  id: 42,
  seller: "0xAlice...",
  amountUSDC: "100.000000", // 100 USDC (6 decimals)
  priceBOB: "500.0", // 500 BOB
  status: "Created",
  deadline: "2025-07-05T12:00:00Z"
};
```
Step 2: Bob Accepts the Order
Bob clicks "Accept Order"
‚Üì
Frontend shows confirmation modal:
- "You will pay: 500 BOB"
- "You will receive: 100 USDC"
- "To wallet: 0xBob..."
‚Üì
Bob confirms the acceptance
‚Üì
Transaction is sent to OrderBook contract
Smart Contract Interaction:
```
solidity// OrderBook.acceptOrder() is called
function acceptOrder(uint256 orderId) external {
    Order storage order = orders[orderId];
    
    // Validation checks
    require(order.status == OrderStatus.Created);
    require(block.timestamp <= order.deadline);
    
    // Update order
    order.buyer = msg.sender; // Bob's address
    order.status = OrderStatus.Accepted;
    
    // Update UserOperation with Bob's address as recipient
    order.userOp.callData = abi.encodeWithSelector(
        IERC20.transfer.selector,
        msg.sender, // Bob will receive the USDC
        order.amountUSDC
    );
    
    emit OrderAccepted(orderId, msg.sender);
}
```

Step 3: Bob Gets Payment Instructions
Order acceptance confirmed ‚úÖ
‚Üì
Frontend automatically shows payment details:
- "Send exactly 500 BOB to Alice"
- Bank account details for Alice
- Payment reference: "P2P-ORDER-42"
- Important: "Include this reference in your transfer"
‚Üì
Timer starts: "Complete payment within 30 minutes"
UI Display:
```
javascript// Bob sees this payment screen
const paymentInstructions = {
  amount: "500.00 BOB",
  recipient: "Alice Rodriguez",
  bankAccount: "BANCO-123-456789",
  reference: "P2P-ORDER-42",
  deadline: "30 minutes remaining"
};
```
Step 4: Bob Makes the Bank Transfer
Bob opens his banking app
‚Üì
Creates a new transfer:
- Recipient: Alice Rodriguez
- Account: BANCO-123-456789
- Amount: 500.00 BOB
- Reference: "P2P-ORDER-42" ‚ö†Ô∏è (Critical!)
‚Üì
Confirms and sends the transfer
‚Üì
Returns to P2P dApp
‚Üì
Clicks "I have completed the payment"
Backend Process:
```
javascript// When Bob clicks "Payment completed"
const bankTransfer = {
  fromAccount: "bob-bank-123",
  toAccount: "alice-bank-456", 
  amount: 500.00,
  reference: "P2P-ORDER-42",
  timestamp: "2025-07-04T10:30:00Z",
  status: "processing" // Bank is processing
};
```
Step 5: Automatic Payment Verification
OrderBook contract detects "payment completed" signal
‚Üì
Triggers Chainlink Functions to verify payment
‚Üì
Chainlink calls Banking API with:
- Order ID: 42
- Expected amount: 500 BOB  
- Expected reference: "P2P-ORDER-42"
- Alice's account details
‚Üì
Banking API responds: "Payment confirmed ‚úÖ"
Chainlink Functions Code:
```
javascript// This runs off-chain via Chainlink
const orderId = args[0]; // "42"
const expectedAmount = args[1]; // "500"
const reference = args[2]; // "P2P-ORDER-42"

const apiResponse = await Functions.makeHttpRequest({
  url: `${bankingApiUrl}/api/v1/transfers/verify`,
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Authorization": `Bearer ${apiKey}` },
  data: {
    orderId: orderId,
    expectedAmount: expectedAmount,
    reference: reference,
    recipientAccount: "alice-bank-456"
  }
});

// Banking API confirms payment exists
if (apiResponse.data.confirmed === true) {
  return Functions.encodeUint256(1); // Verified!
} else {
  return Functions.encodeUint256(0); // Not found
}
```
Step 6: Smart Contract Executes the Trade
Chainlink Functions returns "1" (verified)
‚Üì
OrderBook.fulfillRequest() is called automatically
‚Üì
Contract triggers UserOperation execution:
- Uses Alice's pre-signed EIP-7702 authorization
- Transfers 100 USDC from Alice's smart wallet to Bob
- No gas fees for Alice (gasless transaction)
‚Üì
Trade completed! üéâ
Smart Contract Execution:
```
solidityfunction fulfillRequest(bytes32 requestId, bytes memory response, bytes memory err) internal override {
    uint256 orderId = requestIdToOrderId[requestId];
    Order storage order = orders[orderId];
    
    uint256 result = abi.decode(response, (uint256));
    
    if (result == 1) { // Payment verified
        order.status = OrderStatus.PaymentVerified;
        _executeOrder(orderId); // Execute the USDC transfer
    }
}

function _executeOrder(uint256 orderId) internal {
    Order storage order = orders[orderId];
    
    // Submit Alice's pre-signed UserOperation to EntryPoint
    UserOperation[] memory ops = new UserOperation[](1);
    ops[0] = order.userOp; // Contains Alice's signature
    
    // EntryPoint executes: Alice's wallet ‚Üí transfer 100 USDC ‚Üí Bob
    ENTRY_POINT.handleOps(ops, payable(address(this)));
    
    order.status = OrderStatus.Completed;
    emit OrderCompleted(orderId, order.seller, order.buyer, order.amountUSDC);
}
```
Step 7: Bob Receives Confirmation
Bob's wallet balance updates: +100 USDC ‚úÖ
‚Üì
Frontend shows success message:
- "Trade completed successfully!"
- "You received: 100 USDC"
- "Transaction hash: 0x..."
- "Rate your experience with Alice"
‚Üì
Bob can now use his 100 USDC for other purposes
Final State:
```
javascript// Order final state
const completedOrder = {
  id: 42,
  seller: "0xAlice...",
  buyer: "0xBob...",
  amountUSDC: "100.000000",
  priceBOB: "500.0",
  status: "Completed", // ‚úÖ
  completedAt: "2025-07-04T10:35:00Z"
};

// Bob's wallet
bobWallet.balance.USDC += 100; // ‚úÖ Bob received USDC

// Alice's bank account  
aliceBank.balance.BOB += 500; // ‚úÖ Alice received fiat
```

üîê Security & Trust Mechanisms
For Bob (Buyer Protection):

Escrow-like Security: Alice's USDC is "locked" via smart contract - she can't spend it elsewhere
Atomic Settlement: USDC is only transferred if and only if payment is verified
No Prepayment: Bob pays fiat directly to Alice's bank account (no intermediary)
Transparency: All steps are visible on blockchain

For Alice (Seller Protection):

Payment Verification: Chainlink Functions confirms bank transfer before releasing USDC
Non-Custodial: Her USDC never leaves her control until payment is confirmed
Gasless: She doesn't pay gas fees for the final transfer (EIP-7702 magic)
Reference Matching: System verifies correct payment reference

Trust Requirements:

Banking API: Must accurately report payment status
Chainlink Functions: Trusted oracle for off-chain verification
Smart Contracts: Audited and verified on blockchain
Payment Reference: Bob must include correct reference in bank transfer

üö® Failure Scenarios & Handling
If Bob doesn't pay:

Order expires after 30 minutes
Alice's USDC remains in her wallet
Bob can't claim the USDC

If Bob pays wrong amount:

Chainlink verification fails
Order remains in "Accepted" state
Alice keeps her USDC, Bob keeps his money
Bob can pay the difference or cancel

If Bob forgets payment reference:

Bank transfer won't be matched to order
Verification fails
Trade doesn't execute
Bob can contact support to resolve

If banking API is down:

Chainlink Functions will retry
Order has extended deadline
Manual verification possible as backup

This flow ensures Bob gets exactly what he pays for, while Alice is protected from payment fraud - all without either party needing to trust a centralized exchange! üéâ
